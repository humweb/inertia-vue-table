# What is InertiaVueTables?

InertiaVueTables is built with Inertia and Vue on the frontend and Laravel on the backend.
It was created to easily build, filter and sort table data.
It comes with a wide range of useful configurations to make presenting table data as easy as possible.

## Motivation

With newer technologies comes better and easier ways of doing things.
I found myself not able to find a table component that did exactly what i wanted.
So rather than building out custom table components everytime I wanted to display a table, I created these packages.
