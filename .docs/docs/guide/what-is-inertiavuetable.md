# What is InertiaVueTable?

InertiaVueTable's frontend is built on top of Inertia and Vue with backend for Laravel.
It was created to easily build, filter and sort table data.
It comes with a wide range of useful backend configurations to automatically build out the frontend interface.

## Motivation

With newer technologies comes better and easier ways of doing things.
I found myself not able to find a table component that did everything I wanted and nothing I didn't.
So rather than building out custom table components everytime I wanted to display a table, I created these packages.
